# Cable-PillarWiseLoad
REL-GIS have mapped all their electrical transmission and distribution assets (featureâ€™s)
which includes Power Transformer, Distribution Transformer, Circuit Breaker, Switch,
etc. REL uses GIS to superimpose these complete electrical network assets from
distribution centre to service point on top of the land base data. Thus together as group
they represent entire REL T & D network and are viewed from single GIS window.
Increase in use of GIS technology within the utility sector for better decision making has
demanded further break down of existing single complex electrical network into HT and
LT network. In general, Distribution Transformer can be said to be the feature that helps
in separating these networks by transforming power from 11kV (HT Network) into 440V
(LT Network). In LT Network, total actual load on the DT depends upon the number of
Pillars (in turn no. of customers (COID)) connected downstream.
Objective of RELGIS-Cable section and Pillar wise Load calculation (CSPL) tool is to
Calculate Load on each pillar (for a given DT), generate its Pillar wise Load Calculation
report i.e. (Summary report) and Cable section wise load calculation report (Detailed
Report).
